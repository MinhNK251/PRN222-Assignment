INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (112, 204, 292030, 4, N'The Witcher 3 isn’t just a game. It’s a towering achievement in storytelling, world-building, smooth combat system, inventory management, exploration and game design. Every element, from its morally complex narrative to its richly detailed world, is crafted with incredible care and respect for the source material and for the player. What makes it truly stand out, even 10 years after its release, is its grounded, mature tone and its refusal to talk down to its audience. It doesn’t rely on trends, gimmicks, or preachy undertones. Instead, it delivers a deep, nuanced adventure that trusts you to think, explore, and get lost in a world that feels genuinely lived-in.Geralt is a compelling protagonist, the quests are unforgettable, and the choices you make actually matter. This is the kind of game that reminds us what RPGs should be, driven by character, consequence, and immersive storytelling, not by checklists or ideology. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Playing this game is like entering the world of Game of Thrones, Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter combined. This game is a heaven for fantasy lovers. Rating 10/10: Best game of all time!



The game is hugely immersive and has no weak points in my opinion, must play. I can''t wait to continue the journey through Heart & Stone and Blood & Wine DLCs after taking a break.

(Russian review below)

After hundreds of hours spent in Sapkowski’s universe, you come to realize — there is no way out of there.

[b]The game[/b] that my fifteen-year-old self once met with skepticism still inspires, surprises, and sets the highest standards even ten years later.

[b]The books[/b] that gave birth not just to games, but to a whole new and unique perception of Eastern European medievalism. [b]Sorceresses[/b], royal intrigues, and the clumsy neutrality we’re forced to break again and again. Difficult and brutal choices.

The swamps of Velen, bustling Novigrad, the free isles of Skellige. Cozy Kaer Morhen and the boundless vineyards of Toussaint.

[b]Ciri[/b], whose appearance on screen always takes us right back to the pages of the books. And of course, [b]Gwent[/b]. Thank you for existing.

Thank you for the wonderful time, the emotions, and the adventures. No ratings are needed here. Only endless awe at the depth of the storytelling, the richness of the world, the beloved characters, and the countless details—impossible to catch them all, not in one playthrough, nor five.

And while this may sound like a farewell, returning to the Path is inevitable.
Of course, we deserve a bit of a rest - swords and armor carefully placed on their stands at Corvo Bianco, all achievements unlocked, and Roach resting in her stable.

But we all know - If [i][b]something ends, something begins.[/b][/i]

* * *

[h1]«Что-то кончается…»[/h1]

Спустя сотни часов во Вселенной пана Сапковского осознаешь, что выхода отсюда не существует. 

[b]Игра[/b], к которой пятнадцатилетний я отнесся скептически, сегодня, спустя десять лет, продолжает вдохновлять, удивлять и задавать высочайшие стандарты.

[b]Книги[/b], которые положили начало не столько играм, сколько новому, особенному восприятию восточноевропейского средневековья. [b]Чародейки[/b], королевские интриги и неуклюжий нейтралитет, который нам приходится нарушать раз за разом. 
 Непростые и жестокие решения.

Болота Велена, шумный Новиград, вольные острова Скеллиге. Уютный Каэр Морхен и бескрайние виноградники Туссента.

[b]Цири[/b], чье появление на экране снова и снова отправляет нас обратно на книжные страницы. И, разумеется, [b]гвинт[/b]. Спасибо, что ты есть.

Спасибо за чудесное время, эмоции и приключения. Здесь не нужны оценки. Только бесконечный восторг от глубины повествования, разнообразия мира, любимых персонажей и еще стольких деталей – ни за одно, ни за пять прохождений за всеми не уследить.

И хотя это выглядит как прощание, возвращение на большак неизбежно. Конечно, нам полагается отдых, мечи и броня аккуратно сложены на стойках в Корво Бьянко, все достижения получены, а Плотва уже отдыхает в своем стойле. 

Но мы-то с вами знаем – [i][b]если что-то кончается, что-то начинается.[/b][/i]', '2025-06-21 07:55:31');

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (118, 138, 227300, 5, N'My father played this game a lot, sim games was generally his thing a lot of the times. Unfortunately he passed away back in 2021. I had bought this game a couple months after he passed away. I wished I had gotten it sooner because this game is such a chill game to have.

At the time of writing this, SCS has most of Europe either made or is making. The base game is pretty good on its own however nowadays it is very evident that in order to really enjoy ETS 2, you''re going to have to pay a little bit more for some regions but you can piecemeal your purchases whenever the DLCs come onto sale.

The gameplay is relatively basic, you pick up a trailer, drive to the destination, and then drop it off. That in itself can be very boring to some but I think with the amount of points of interest, it may give some life to your journey. The devs do lean on the beauty of Europe and the different landscapes it has to offer so much so that they even allow you to stop your truck in a spot and take in a view they think is interesting.

Though this game does tend to make you want to listen to a video, podcast, music, or whatever but you''re literally driving so if you like driving IRL then this game could be for you if you want to not have so much stress IRL worrying about a million things.

The game gives me a silly itch that I never thought I sometimes need, I suppose my father was onto something when he played this game.

TL;DR Good chill game but basic gameplay at its core.', '2025-06-14 01:03:14');

You spawn in with nothing—literally naked—and within five minutes, you''re either freezing, starving, getting mauled by something with claws, or all three. It’s chaotic and confusing. But then it starts to click. You start to tame your dinosaurs, build your base, and survive. That feeling is awesome.

The world is huge, the dinosaurs are incredible, and the sense of progression is satisfying. ARK is wild, and often unfair—but it’s also really addictive.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (133, 255, 892970, 3, N'this game is so good... when i can see what is going on. 

which, unfortunately, is only half the time. 

they seem to have decided that "being really dark to the point it strains your eyesight" is a really fun biome feature. I''m pretty sure that playing this game has damaged my eyesight.



also the power creep on the enemies is huge, the mobs from the next biome up will insta-kill you! no chance no hope you are dead if they see you! 

This is harsh because biomes 3/4/5 can border biome 1. 

  

it starts so well, the meadows and black forest are delightful, beautiful and fun, if challenging to play in. 



the swamp is miserable, just generally horrible, it literally turns to night and rains as you enter the swamp. you look in from the forest or meadows and the swamp looks cool. but as soon as you set foot in it it goes dark and starts raining. You are there for hours gathering resources and battling horrific brutal undead, but the whole time the dark and rain make it so depressing. 

its not a fun experience. 

if it had proper day and night at the same levels as the rest, it would be a much better biome. 

but you only have to suffer through the one bizarrely dark biome, right?



The mountains are bright (too bright) and open and beautiful, if tricky and treacherous to navigate. again power creep on the mobs is huge. but its a cool biome. its a shame there aren''t more uses for the resources you collect. obsidian is good for arrows for a bit, but the mountain crystals are worthless, and the stone golems are just there to ruin your day, they drop nothing. 



The plains are awesome. big, bright, open, so cool. the lox, deathsquitos and growths are super dangerous, but the lox are awesome when tamed. the fulings are really interesting. there should be some fuling or dvergr mines in the plains to explore. 

 if magic was introduced in the plains or the mountains this would be the best biome by far. (the Dvergr could be battling the fullings on the plains for access to ygdrasil roots, then we encounter the shoots high up in the mistlands) but its like they forgot to add a whole resource stream to the plains leaving the biome half finished. its still one of the best biomes, though.   

     

The mistlands is the worst!

it should be the most visually stunning biome and on the rare occasion you can see any of it, its very cool. 

but its permanently dark and shrouded in mist. so you cant see anything any of the time. its just pure frustration. the mistlands changed the game from an open world survival exploration game into a crappy platformer. "jump jump jump jump dead!" and repeat. 

if your stamina runs out you are dead so you need high stamina.

the enemies hit really hard so you need high health or you are dead.

so this is the biome where they introduced a third metric in the eitr that fuels your magic... which you have to sacrifice both health and stamina to use. 

The eitr foods are terribly designed.

There are 3, they all, give majority eitr a bit of health and a tiny bit of stamina so there isnt a choice. seeker aspic is the best, it gives more stats for fewer resources and it lasts longer. then ygdrasil porrige, if you want a second eitr food, and stuffed mushrooms are rubbish, not only do the stuffed mushrooms give less on all stats, but they require more ingredients and have a 2 stage cooking process! 

 as eitr foods they should all give majority eitr, but one should give more health than stamina, another more stamina than health and the third should give equal health and stamina, so that there is a decision to make. 

then theres the feast, "mushrooms a la mistlands"... which doesn''t really require any mushrooms. *facepalm*

the mobs in the mistlands are cool, the infested mines, the dvergr, the accursed Gjall....

but its just so dark and miserable. 

can we have some daylight, please?!



then we finally kill the queen in the most boring drawn out fight ever.... and we can finally sail to the ashlands.

.... where its deliberately dark and miserable!



the mobs and weather have been programmed by "that guy". the wind always swings round to blow from where you are trying to sail to. 

if you are running out of your limited gaming time something will hunt you down and stop you getting to a safe save point, making your whole game session a frustrating waste of time.



how to improve this game:

1. sort out the lighting.

dark is miserable. miserable is a crappy gaming experience. if night and day are important in this game then give us proper night and day IN EVERY BIOME!

2. magic. 

magic is cool but its introduced at a stage where its useless. if it turned up earlier in the game it would be so much better and it''d vastly improve the game. 

there are literally resource gaps in the plains and the mountains, compared to other biomes. 

the eitr weave suit ought to be the alternative armour for the Plains, biome, its mostly made of plains materials anyway.

The frost caves are just lacking in purpose, there are loads of crystals that are practically useless, you meet the fire slinging cultists in there, why isn''t the fire staff something you can get from them? 

on the plains the fuling shamen are also slinging magic, they should also be a source of magic resources.



2.a. Hildir''s quests are pretty pointless. you get nothing for completing them. 

they should be the key to unlocking magic.

The dead raiser should be in the smouldering tomb.

the ice staff should be in the howling cavern, 

and the staff of protection should be in the sealed tower. 



NOW Hildir is worth visiting for more than the barber''s kit!

     

fishing sucks!

it is easier and quicker to catch and kill a giant sea dragon, than it is to catch a basic level 1 fish!

if you try to catch a higher level or more exotic fish you need your best stamina foods and stamina meads, you have to source and craft the right bait... its like prepping for a boss battle, then it takes hours of actual time, and the benefits are negligible. 



if you could make a net that could be set from the boat and used to catch a shoal of fish then fishing could be a part of the game, but as it is fishing in valhiem is a complete waste of time and resources.      



there need to be more craftable items. you end up with so many useless resources. 



the Bosses

the boss fights are just drawn out and tedious. I hate the way you are forced to defeat the boss to get the item to progress to the next biome. the Forssken powers are terribly imbalanced. 

The Forsaken powers from eikthyr, moder and the elder, are barely used and wouldn''t be out of place if they were permanent character upgrades. 

in fact, as permanent upgrades they would just improve the gameplay and make the boss fights worthwhile.

once you get to bonemass, its such a powerful "get out of jail free" card that you just don''t look at any of the others again.  and its such a faff to return to the stones to reset the power that you just don''t bother.



in short, valheim has a lot of potential, but it still needs a lot of work.', '2025-06-08 14:23:38');

Assuming that official klei-hosted servers are the intended experience, it is a game that resets your entire server if everyone dies, and yet to actually dominate and beat the final bosses you need at least about 20 hours or more depending on how well your team knows what to do. The thing is, this game has very slow power progression, even if you rush thulecite clubs or mass produce glass cutters, it still requires a lot of farming for armor to survive the hard hitting meatshield bosses of late-game to get to actually damaging brightshade and void gear.

My point is, for it to be more feasible to actually complete this game in public lobbies they need to give us more viable early game weapons, and especially armor, because current meta of filling your inventory with 5 football helmets is ridiculous, and kiting in public is almost impossible.
Actually one thing that addresses some of this is skill tree, but then please give every character something to improve their combat, Wilson is currently very underwhelming.


Okay it was a long rant, kinda creates an illusion of me not liking the game.

Dark Souls 3 é o retorno triunfal da série após a mancada que foi Dark 2. Dessa vez, a FromSoftware resolveu jogar seguro e encerrar a saga com dignidade, e, na minha opinião, conseguiu com sucesso.
O jogo é recheado de fan service para quem acompanhou o primeiro Dark Souls. Majula sai e volta Firelink Shrine. Anor Londo está de volta. Siegward de Catarina. Havel, o Ferreiro Gigante, e até mesmo Gwyndolin, sim, ele sobreviveu e está sendo consumido vivo por Aldrich, o Devorador de Deuses! 
Até o chefe final é uma homenagem direta ao primeiro jogo e aos próprios jogadores. Simplesmente genial.
Na parte técnica, o jogo entrega tudo: gráficos dignos da geração, trilha sonora fantástica e chefes memoráveis. 
Uma coisa que pode decepcionar os mais hardcores: Para mim Dark Souls 3 é SoulsLike mais facil que a From Software fez. Embora mais facil que os outros jogos ainda é um jogo bem  desafiador principalmente para quem quer fazer o 100%.
O único ponto que não ficou perfeito mais que a From conseguiu entregar de maneira satisfatoria era a conexão de mundo que Dark Souls 1 e Bloodbonne fazia tão bem. Em DS3 existem sim conexões, você consegue ver as outras áreas no horizonte, mas não é a mesma coisa que descer de elevador da Catedral em Undead Parish direto para Firelink Shrine, ou subir a torre de Darkroot Garden para sair em Undead Burg. Essa sensação de mundo interligado está infinitamente melhor que Dark Souls 2, mas longe do que era em DS1.
No fim, Dark Souls 3 é tudo o que um fã da série poderia esperar para encerrá-la com chave de ouro.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (161, 135, 377160, 4, N'In short – is this game worth buying?
Absolutely! For the sheer amount of content and the general price-to-content ratio. I bought the GOTY edition for around $8, and it’s worth every cent. Even at the full price of $30, there’s enough content to justify the purchase.

Is it a good game?
Well… there’s a good game hidden away in it, but it’s easy to lose yourself in the chaos that this game is.

Fallout 4 feels like five different games mashed into one. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — it’s an ambitious project — but I don’t think it’s handled very well. It’s a sandbox open-world action RPG you can play in FPS or TPS perspective, and it’s also a post-apocalyptic survival game with elements of settlement management, base building, and even tower defense. But if you want to play a good RPG, there are far better options on the market, even within the Fallout franchise. If you want a solid FPS/TPS, this isn’t the best either. Same goes for the survival aspect. The management/building part is actually my favorite — I don’t know if it’s the best game of that type, but it’s good and very addictive.

Although the idea of combining different mechanics into one complex game is solid, Bethesda (read: Todd Howard) crammed too many components into it. They could’ve made one great FPS/TPS action RPG in the style of previous Fallout games, and a separate spin-off — an open-world survival/management game.
And why is it better to make two games instead of one?
Because when you go for quantity, you sacrifice quality — and in this case, also stability and playability.

The most important thing for me in an RPG, besides the story and mechanics, is the character leveling system — and how it applies to your progress and battles. Fallout 4 (besides Fallout 76) has the most simplistic, streamlined, and downgraded leveling system in the franchise. Every time you level up, you get one point — invest it in a SPECIAL attribute or perk, and that’s it. So unfulfilling and unsatisfying. In previous titles, you could balance attributes, skills, perks, and traits — with a finite number of points that made your character just powerful enough to get through the game, but not some OP god coasting through with zero effort.

That’s the thing with combat — depending on difficulty and your skill, the game starts off kind of challenging, and later becomes an effortless, tedious slog. Enemies, like in all Bethesda games, scale to your level. But instead of combat getting smarter or more strategic, enemies just get more hit points. So one raider can take 50 headshots with a sniper rifle — right in the center of the eye — and still function like nothing happened. Sometimes, you’ll burn through thousands of rounds in a single encounter on higher difficulties.

So, what’s the problem — and is there a way to fix it?
The biggest problem is the head of Bethesda — the “creative force” behind modern Fallout — Todd Howard, the Megalomaniac. His way of thinking is absolutely reflected in this game. The same way he mashed every genre into one title, you can be everything and do everything in one loooooooooooooong playthrough. No need for a second. You probably won’t even finish the first because you’ll get bored, overwhelmed, or just lost in the sea of content.

I finished the game at level ~90, but you can go way beyond that. There are enough perks to choose up to level 286, and you can go even higher — become Todd the God.

And what could be a solution to this mess?
Make a shorter game. Go for quality, not quantity. Pick a path and close off the others — not at the end of the game, but from the beginning. Make a game where choices actually matter, where your decisions shape the world and your experience. Make a game you’ll want to play again — and have a different journey the second, third, fourth time.
Finite resources. Finite XP. No more level scaling. No more radiant filler quests.
Make battles strategically challenging. Make enemies smart and deadly — not bullet-sponge immortals. Give us a complex but rewarding leveling system that makes every point count.

STORY is decent, but not the best in the Fallout universe. In my personal opinion, Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas are much better — both in terms of story and overall RPG quality. This one is more like Fallout 3, but with more content. Fallout 76 still takes the crown as the worst on my list — in every aspect.

The lore is rich. There’s a LOT to read and listen to, but the quality ranges from brilliant to downright stupid and nonsensical. Same goes for dialogue and decisions. There are great storylines and quests — but I feel like more than 50% of the writing is just filler.

VISUALLY, the game is also a mixed bag — but overall, one of the better aspects. Sometimes I’m amazed by the beauty and the sheer amount of work that went into it. Other times, it feels like they missed the tone and atmosphere Fallout is known for.

One thing I really liked is the asset design — enemies, weapons, armors, clothing, clutter, etc. I know many fans would disagree, but to me, the concept art, design, and 3D renders of the Super Mutants are the best in the series. Same goes for the Deathclaws — they look better than ever. Even the Ghouls look and animate great. In general, most enemies look awesome.

Human NPCs? Not so much. Some are okay, but many look like dirty, uncanny half-caricatures.
Weapons, though? Amazing. Great variety and design. Same for armor and clothing.
Customization might be one of the best in gaming history — especially with mods.
The scenery ranges from jaw-dropping to overly cluttered or too colorful — not always fitting the post-apocalyptic tone.

GAMEPLAY — already covered most of it. It''s a confusing mess, but very addictive. For me, the loop was always the same:
Leave the settlement → explore → collect → find new locations → do a few quests → get overloaded → go back → build → upgrade gear → cook → repeat.
Leveling is underwhelming, but you still have to plan your build early, especially on higher difficulties or in survival mode.

MODS – Absolutely essential!
I wouldn’t even touch this game without mods (same goes for any Bethesda game). It’s not easy — it takes time, some knowledge, and carries risks. If you don’t know what you''re doing, you can break the game easily. But if you do it right, you can shape the game into something you want to play. Focus on the parts you enjoy and make them near-perfect. Make it more stable, smoother, better looking, more focused — whatever you want.
There are around 70,000 mods online.
Do yourself a favor — learn the basics, watch a few tutorials, and experience the best version of this game.

The earth had been scorched, the skies forever dimmed, and the echoes of the old world still clung to the bones of broken cities. I had just lost all that was dear: [spoiler]my home, my love, and the child I swore to protect. In a single breath, the warmth of the past was turned to cold memory.[/spoiler]

And yet… I emerged. From the metal womb of Vault 111, into a world reborn in ruin.
The surface was not what it once was — no, it was something else entirely.
Alive. Chaotic. Honest.

Every step forward was a test. Sometimes, I survived with only my fists and will. Sometimes with a pipe pistol held together by rust and desperation. Other times, it was not my strength, but my words — a calm voice, a raised brow, a subtle gesture
that allowed me to walk away from a boiling conflict unscathed. In this world, a sharp tongue is often deadlier than a sharp blade.

The people? Oh, they are many and varied.
Some cling to ideals like rust clings to steel: zealots who pray to atomic gods, raiders who laugh at the sun,
scientists who twist the fabric of life in laboratories forgotten by time. And yet, some are simply lost: scavengers, builders, wanderers… like me. All seeking purpose in the post-apocalyptic dust.

[h1] Fallout 4 does not offer a paradise. It offers potential. [/h1]

You may choose to be a savior, a tyrant, a diplomat, or merely a tired soul gathering scrap to build a single, sturdy wall in a world where nothing stands for long. You can rebuild towns. You can ignite wars. You can even dress your dog in goggles and call it destiny.

Yes, it is a dark world. Yes, it reminds us painfully of what happens when greed outpaces wisdom. But in that desolation, there is also room for laughter, for stories by the campfire, for sarcastic robots and teddy bears holding cigars. 
It is a world as absurd as it is tragic.

Perhaps that is the lesson hidden in all the rubble:
Even after the bombs fall, even when all is lost there is still something worth fighting for.
And sometimes, something worth smiling about.', '2025-06-26 21:44:41');

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (164, 131, 221100, 4, N'DayZ remains the best post-apocalyptic survival game available. I started it playing in 2015 as a mod through Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead. It was the first game I bought when I got my own computer and access to Windows games — so a brief forewarning for some bias here. A full decade later, the standalone release is at point now where I would consider it complete.  

With the 1.28 update, Bohemia conjured the idea of using vehicle code from Arma: Reforger in DayZ. By doing so, they''ve (almost) completely fixed how vehicles behave. For context, vehicles in DayZ were notoriously unreliable; players often encountered laughable physics and lag compensation, which would result in their demise and/or the destruction of their car. With a 225 km² playable area, motorised transport is obviously desired. These issues have long plagued the game, and made vehicles simply not worth the effort of finding and maintaining. This was an thorn, because DayZ''s predecessor, made on Arma 2, was a military-simulator with intricate detail and consistent vehicle behaviour. As you''d expect, [u] 1.28 is a game-changer. [/u]

Base building is in the vanilla game, but needs work to make the time-sink worth it. Modded community servers arguably showcase a more realised version of permanency in the post-apocalypse, however, I ultimately prefer playing on Official or Vanilla community servers. I don''t use stashes or build bases, I treat every life as its own playthrough and try to remember [u] its not your gear, it''s just your turn with it[/u] which can can help stifle the blow of losing a well-geared character to that moving bush with a sniper rifle. Even after 1000~ hours, and more on its predecessor, across all the "soldier simulation" games I''ve played, DayZ is the only one that really scares you with its PvP interactions — left thinking you''re going into cardiac arrest b/c of the heart-pounding gunfights you''ll find yourself in after not seeing another player for hours.', '2025-06-18 02:36:53');

2. Very hard on a solo player both in terms of time and progress.

3. Hard to be stealthy even as a solo. 

4. If your only purpose is to survive as long as you can without caring about other players, you can do fine without ever dying or not dying often. That means you won''t get the best gear but you will be alive.

5. If you want to actually enjoy the game and fight, you need to find a way to hide your gear and as a solo this is harder said than done. 

6. Do not recommend using shovels for stashes, it''s dangerous to stay in one place, you can''t bury much and you can hear it which attracts attention. Use shovels for growing vegetables only.

7. Use fishing poles, boil food with a pot and a gas stove. 

8. Don''t build bases as a solo unless they are a decoy. 

9. Don''t use tents and shelters as a solo unless they are a decoy or to temporary stash that you are gonna move soon. 

10. Learn situational awareness. Listen often, look often. 

11. Don''t fight without the element of surprise, unless you are searching for a fight and you happened to get discovered before you discovered them. 

12. As a fresh spawn find a gun with a few bullets, get a bit of food and listen for shots to ambush someone. Don''t needlessly run across towns with other players. Unless you have a party, in-game parties aren''t a well organized group and most people don''t know what they are doing. You might have some fun but you will die trying to stay together. 

The game is good. To an extent it might be better to have more frequent wipes just so that you don''t grow attached to your gear since you can''t really keep it for too long as a solo. There is almost no other way to effectively solve spending tons of time getting to the level of big groups.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (168, 190, 251570, 4, N'📢HISTORICAL HISTORY and BUGS are reasons behind the current state of the game TODAY
In the last few years during development of 7d2d one of the original developers of this game departed the team due to a lawsuit resulting in loss of significant vision, coding, and ideas for the game. 
To make matters worse shortly after his departure, a tragic event occurred when another developer died in a car accident. This incident considerably hindered progress in various aspects of the game, as it meant losing his insights, direction, and advancements for the game.

Additionally, one must also consider the two brothers who, over the years have consistently appeared to have differing visions for the game''s trajectory and plans. They have been involved with every stage and aspect of the game since the inception of the game was conceived during a holiday dinner that they visioned many years ago.
I firmly believe that the reason we observe varying elements and features in one alpha version compared to another is due to the constant addition and removal of features and items, as the brothers possess distinct different ideas and perspectives regarding the game''s direction from alpha to alpha.

Following the significant losses of both developers, tfp have employed numerous graphic designers to implement their ideas and influences, rather than concentrating on long-standing issues and bugs that have existed over the years. Unfortunately, they seem to prioritize their vision of what the game should be, while the real issue lies in the fact that there is only one developer who appears to be dedicated solely to addressing longstanding bugs. This individual is overwhelmed with work on bandits, resulting in many bugs not being resolved in a timely manner, leading to bugs persistence from one alpha version to the next.

Moreover, players are continually urging for the 3.0 bandit update, which I believe has diverted their focus away from more pressing matters allowing significant bugs to persist. It is not a question of the developers lacking personnel to develop the game, as they have hired people. The challenge lies in the fact that these new hires often have different objectives and do not focus on bug fixs and most of them where not present from the beginning. This is where effective leadership is crucial to align everyone towards a common goal and ensure a unified focus. Instead of continuing with the current 3.0 road map i believe the game would benefit more in the long run if tfp would designate their time and resources to a bug patch. The player community would appreciate bugs fixed alot more than a few features added.', '2025-06-12 19:41:10');

One of Isaac''s strengths stems from what causes this initial confusion. There are HUNDREDS of items and dozens of bosses. Many of the items have synergies and interactions with each other, the environment, and game mechanics. This complexity rewards the player for learning and understanding the game, and helps make each run relatively fresh, even after hundreds of hours and runs.

I understand that my point of view and playtime of Deep Rock Galactic aren''t the norm, but seeing as how I love this game and have a lot to say about it, I think it''s worth exploring those opinions and thoughts.

DRG, at its core, is a class-based co-op shooter set in procedurally generated caves. Your goal in every mission is to collect resources by mining ores and shooting a lot, and I mean A LOT of bugs. There are four classes to choose from, each having their own weapons, movement abilities, and most importantly, role and "job" in the team. You can level up your class by collecting upgrade materials in missions, used to add buffs to weapons and movement tools. 

Now on the whole, that is about as brief of a summary I can give without going into the minutiae of Deep Rock Galactic. There are a LOT of other details about the gameplay loop, class perks, Overclocks, and the roles and quirks of the classes themselves. However, if you would like the joy of learning and experience all of that on your own and wouldn''t like to read my thesis on DRG, then you can stop reading and take my recommendation and pull the trigger on purchasing the game. 

For those still interested in reading, strap in.

To give some context on how and why I''m writing the rest of this review, I''ll start with how I began playing DRG and why I continue to play it. This was my comfort game during the s**tshow that was the year 2020. My friends and I picked up the game to help us through the trying time, and we were hooked. Fast forward five years, and I am the only one of my original friend group who has over 200 hours in the game or plays it today. As their interest waned in the game, I played more and more with randoms in public lobbies, which led me to play with people in the official Discord server, where I met some really great people and became friends with a lot of them.

I say all of that because a lot of multiplayer or co-op games rely on, and indeed assume, that you are playing with friends or at least people who make the game entertaining in its own right. I have never held a belief that a game which is "more fun with friends" is a good thing in and of itself. Technically, ANYTHING is more fun with friends. A s**t game is more fun with friends. It doesn''t mean the game itself is worth playing. 

Deep Rock Galactic, on the other hand, allows for fun to be had regardless of whether you''re with a group of close buddies or complete strangers. A lot of that is due to the amount of agency and player autonomy each person has in the group. There aren''t any keycards or similar that require two or more people to simultaneously engage with. There aren''t specific enemies that require elite military-like coordination in order to take down. Each player and class has, to varying degrees, a manner to handle any and all situations the game throws at you. Obviously, certain classes and playstyles have their strengths and weaknesses, and good teamwork is always desirable, but there''s not really any reliance on teammates outside of picking up downed players. DRG walks a very fine tightrope of giving each individual freedom to act autonomously, while also giving you an important role in the group context. Which brings us to the classes:

As said, there are four classes to choose from: Driller, Engineer, Gunner, and Scout. Each have their own niche and role in the group:

Driller''s main role in the group is twofold. His primary weapons, with his starter weapon being a flamethrower, allows him to clean up trash and low priority enemies, as well as give debuffs to tankier targets. His movement ability, the drill hands, allows him to tunnel through terrain very quickly and efficiently. He is often seen at the front of the group, making pathways for his teammates and clearing out a spot to fight with both his drills and C4. 

Engineer is probably the hardest to describe succinctly. In lower difficulties and lower bug density environments, he struggles to find a particular role outside of securing holds and points of interest. This is due to his main tool, his automatic turrets, being stationary and moving them around, placing them, and then building them, especially during moments of chaos, can be troublesome. He is also the least ammo efficient class, owing to him having to pick and choose a lot of "fight or flight" moments. However, when the difficulty is raised and larger swarms are part of the mission, he really shines. His aforementioned turrets can help pick off low health enemies, his primaries are all servicable "get off me" weapons, and two of his three secondaries are quite amazing at killing large groups of enemies very quickly (Sorry PGL, hope you get the love you deserve someday <3). His movement tool, the platform gun, allows for you to place "shelves" into walls allowing for players to climb and scale up terrain very easily. It also has a lot of hidden tech that I don''t really need to get into here, and is largely the most slept-on portion of his kit. 

Gunner, in contrast, is very easy to describe. He presses LMB, and holds it until he needs to stop pressing it, either when he runs out of bullets or things to shoot. His primaries are all large and in charge, ranging from the standard minigun to a Flak-cannon to a guided missile launcher, all of which pack a punch. He''s also the class with the highest degree of survivability, owing to his insane DPS (Best defense is a good offense), and his bubble shield. His shield can be used offensively, thrown into an unexplored room to clean it out, or defensively, such as reviving a teammate and giving them some breathing room or holding a position. He makes up for all of this by having, in my opinion, the worst and most situational movement tool: The zipline. Slow, dangerous, makes you a target for flying enemies, and capable of falling off of it make it very risky to use it any other way except downhill. 

Last but certainly not least is Scout. As his name suggests, his job is indeed to scout out rooms and light them with his flare gun. I may not have mentioned it yet, but this game is incredibly reliant on light, as the caves can range from dim and atmospheric to pitch black nothingness. He also has access to a grappling hook, which is less Spiderman and more "Look at a wall and get pulled toward it". This leads to a natural progression of logic that Scout is more often than not the resource bag of the team, owing to his ability to reach high up ores and objectives. As for his guns, they are best used to pick off important targets, such as highly disruptive enemies, or enemies that are out of reach of the less accurate guns the other classes might have equipped. 

This seems like a very comprehensive description of what these classes do, but I''m leaving out a lot of synergies and interplay that they have with each other (Volatile Bullets + Flamethrower, Sludge Pump + Fire Bolts, etc). I would go into more details such as Overclocks, perks, difficulties, enemy varieties, and fun little distractions in the Hub area, but I have found out that there is a character limit on Steam reviews... so...

I cannot recommend Deep Rock Galactic enough. It''s so fun I spent an hour and a half thinking of things to put into this review, ran out of space, and am now trying to summarize in what little space I have left. Just buy it and give it a shot. It''s worth your money and time. It''s a blast and I''m still playing five years later.

This game is a mix of cooperation, fun and absurd moments.
You will take part in a mining expedition together with other people (your friends and if you don''t have any, random people).
You can choose between 4 classes of dwarves available, each with its own weapons and characteristics. They are all complementary to each other and useful to the others.
The missions present are of various kinds and you will have to face the fauna present on the map which, by increasing the difficulty, will become more and more aggressive and with "heavier" resources (I''ll let you discover by yourself what I mean).

While you''re in the lobby, you''ll have a variety of activities to while away the time, from simple minigames to wild dancing in front of the jukebox and drinking beer until you pass out (Yes, you can actually do that!)
The graphics of the game are well done and give a good idea of ​​the dark mines and the numerous environmental variety.
Starting from sandy mines and then ending in the middle of ice and lava.
The audio is really great, the game music changes depending on the situation but the incredible thing is the phrasing of the dwarves and mission control. The various phrases pronounced have now become a cult!
Last but not least, is the customization of the character, as well as the weapons. There are a myriad of possible combinations, purchasable in the lobby shop or unlockable.
There are also various events during the year that, upon completion of certain missions, give away additional items.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (180, 150, 548430, 5, N'Rock-solid, beer-soaked, and explosively replayable. A touch of late-game repetition and a slower content drip while Ghost Ship focuses on Rogue Core stop it from hitting legendary status, but Deep Rock Galactic is still the co-op gold standard for anyone who fancies turning space bugs into confetti.

Rating: 8.5 / 10

I drop through the refinery hatch, slam a flare into the cave wall, and watch the underground cathedral bloom in toxic greens and hot-pink minerals. Four dwarf classes—Gunner, Engineer, Scout, Driller—slot together like clockwork: minigun suppression, turret crossfire, grappling-hook scouting, and drill-dozer shortcuts all feeding into one smooth mineral-grinding machine. The environments are fully destructible, the caves are procedural, and the moment you carve a bespoke tunnel to out-flank a Dreadnought you feel like a subterranean genius.

Weapons and gadget upgrades arrive in an almost Borderlands-style gush of overclocks and cosmetics, but the balance is tight enough that a fresh recruit packing a stock shotgun can still hold the line beside a veteran with a radioactive autocannon. Seasonal updates keep the sandbox mutating: 2024’s Season 05 ‘Drilling Deeper’ dropped new Rockpox corruption events and a terraforming drill escort, and March’s S05.09 patch continued the tweak-fest with balance passes and fresh assignment rewards.

The headlamp-lit spectacle is matched by audio that roars and clatters with industrial heft—pickaxes crunch, glyphid armour splinters, and HoPoRo’s synth soundtrack pumps just hard enough to raise a dwarven eyebrow without drowning squad chatter. Performance is equally sturdy: even Steam Deck holds 60 fps once you dial back the volumetric fog, and ultrawide support has inched from “jury-rigged” to “mostly fine” over the past year of patches.

Rough spots remain. After a few hundred dives, the mission pool can start to feel like you’ve mined this vein before, and with Season 06 pushed to late 2025 while the team shepherds its spin-off Rogue Core, the cadence of brand-new objectives has slowed. Solo play is viable thanks to Bosco the drone, but the game’s heart lies in four-pack camaraderie; drop into a lobby of silent randoms and the magic wanes faster than a spent flare.

Yet every time the drop-pod door slams shut and the company jingle barks “Rock and Stone!”, the complaints fall away in a shower of glyphid innards and beer foam. Procedural caverns, endlessly tinkerable load-outs, and a community that still greets strangers with a toast make Deep Rock Galactic feel as fresh in 2025 as the day it exited Early Access. For co-op shooter fans, there’s still nothing quite like it—so grab a round of Oily Oafs, slap a barrel, and get back in the hole.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (183, 158, 489830, 3, N'What''s to say that hasn''t already been said about Skyrim? Perhaps the ultimate first-person (or third-person) action role playing game of its generation (and for many Mllennials, of ours too), The Elder Scrolls V: SKyrim falters only in its scaled-down scope from the previous entry. Some of this can''t be helped because the province of Skyrim is just smaller in size than Cyrodil, which formed the bulk of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but also some of it was trimming of systems and streamlining of combat to get more people into the fold. I''d say the tactic worked, but I also have the unpopular opinion that all the lost attributes, major and minor skills. plus custom magic creation did bog down some of the experience in the previous game, however devilish it could be to abuse those mechanics in order to make godlike characters without needing to actually cheat. The most inportant thing is you can still play your way, with a fully customized character, and even though you technically no longer have classes to guide how your leveling progresses, you can still specialize into a tank or longbow sniper like all the previous games. This formless and limitless leveling system does mean that eventually you can have maximum everything, and will be that ultimate godlike character just from enough playing, but I don''t think there ever was an Elder Scrolls game that you couldn''t break somehow just with enough play time. 

For the average player, they just want an immersive experience that is easy to pick up and hard to put down; they want an escape into another world where they can live out a fantasy, or just get from point A to point B and save the day before popping in another title to play. Skyrim delivered all that, plus an art style that has aged like fine wine to the point most people don''t even care about the fact the engine under the game has more holes than a cheese grater, and was already a generation behind the competition when launched. All the myriad bugs and glitches train the player to save often, and although patches would ultimately get the worst offenders, there is still enough jank left in the game that people playing the game long-term will inevitably seek mods to correct what was left untouched when Bethesda moved on. Luckily, that same mod community has blossomed into one so big that we would end up getting entire DLC-sized expansions to the game, unofficial remastered graphics for those who absolutely need a 15 year-old game to feel like a bloated unoptomized modern one, and all for free. Honestly, I think some of the better expansion mods like Wyrmstooth, Falskaar, and Midwood Isle should be incorporated into the base game, but that''s just me. The fact Tod Howard has spent those 15 years just re-selling this game back to us on different platforms while letting the community extend the life of the title indefinitely with this fan-made content is sort of telling that maybe Bethesda doesn''t believe they can top it. 

The bottom line here is Skyrim did what Oblivion and its predecessor did not, even if it is the svelte, streamlined "Elder Scrolls Lite" entry into the series compared to others in the series. That thing it did was get enough people invested in the game that the aforementioned community of content creators blossomed around it in the first place. Being able to play the game across three console generations, myriad PC generations, and now mobile nearly two decades later is also kinda neat. You can literally play this game forever if you want, and with official Creation Content or free mods to keep adding new adventures, it''s probably still the single best investment in the genre you can make. The pending Beyond Skyrim mod content will also see every single province plugged into the base game with all their own quests, making the whole content of Tamriel playable in an "offline" Elder Scrolls game for the first time since the original entry. Some may argue for Oblivion Remastered, and it sure looks great, plays mostly the same way the original did with quality of life improvements, but you need to have ridiculously expensive hardware to run its shiny and resource-heavy Unreal 5 engine. Skyrim even in it''s decked-out Special Edition with Anniversary Edition content download can basically run on a potato nowadays, so there''s few people out there who can''t play this game, making it even more essential if free-roam action RPGs are your thing.', '2025-06-16 05:12:37');

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (194, 192, 264710, 5, N'Few survival games have aged as gracefully—or left as lasting an impression—as Subnautica. Even in 2025, it remains one of the most immersive and emotionally resonant survival experiences ever crafted.

What starts as a serene oceanic adventure quickly evolves into a harrowing tale of isolation, discovery, and awe, set in one of gaming’s most beautifully realized alien worlds.

You crash-land on Planet 4546B, an ocean world with no dry land in sight. Your only lifeline is a damaged escape pod and the surrounding sea. You must scavenge, craft, and survive—but unlike many games in the genre, Subnautica doesn’t just make survival a grind. It makes it an adventure.

There are no zombies, no NPCs, no guns. Just you, the ocean, and what lies beneath.

And that ocean? It hides wonders. And horrors.

The ocean biomes are the heart and soul of Subnautica—from sunlit shallows filled with docile creatures to pitch-black trenches inhabited by massive, bone-chilling predators. Every zone feels handcrafted, layered with visual storytelling and unique ecosystems.

There’s a real arc of progression: you go from swimming with flippers and a snorkel to piloting deep-diving submarines through ancient alien ruins. And you always feel just a little bit too fragile, too exposed. It’s survival, but also discovery. Fear and fascination constantly dance.

What’s most impressive is how the game guides you without waypoints. Audio logs, signals, wreckage, and environmental cues pull you deeper, both literally and narratively.

Subnautica smartly trims the fat often seen in survival games. There''s:
-Crafting tied to meaningful upgrades (vehicles, suits, tools)
-Resource gathering that rewards exploration instead of grinding
-Base-building that feels like personal expression and strategic necessity
-Food and water meters that add pressure without feeling tedious
-
Every item feels earned. Every dive has purpose.

And while it starts slow, the pace picks up once you begin customizing your base, building your Seamoth (your first submersible), and unlocking alien technologies.

Subnautica is not marketed as a horror game—but it might be one of the scariest games ever made for players with thalassophobia (fear of deep water).

Descending into unknown biomes, with only a flickering headlamp and the distant roar of an unseen leviathan, triggers primal fear. And the game knows it. It masterfully plays with sound design, lighting, and isolation, delivering dread without a single jump scare.

Your only defense? Awareness, speed, and running like hell when something bigger than your sub shows up.

There’s more to Subnautica than just survival. As you uncover the fate of other survivors and the secrets of the planet’s ancient alien structures, you realize you’re part of a much larger mystery.

Themes of quarantine, extinction, and unintended consequences echo eerily close to real-world concerns. And by the time you reach the climax, you feel like you’ve earned your escape—not just logistically, but emotionally.

While not graphically cutting-edge in 2025, Subnautica’s visuals hold up thanks to art direction. The glowing flora, surreal bioluminescence, and shifting ocean light are hypnotic.

But it’s the sound design that elevates it. From the relaxing hum of shallow reef zones to the terrifying roars in the abyss, every sound has purpose. The ambient soundtrack is subtle, haunting, and unforgettable.

Subnautica isn’t just a survival game—it’s a journey of vulnerability, discovery, and ultimately, escape. It taps into both our curiosity and our deepest fears with elegant pacing and environmental mastery.

Even years after its release, few games can replicate the emotional arc it creates: from helpless castaway to confident deep-sea explorer—alone, but never unengaged.

Pros:
-A rich, handcrafted underwater world full of wonder and danger
-Brilliantly atmospheric sound and visual design
-Smart, purpose-driven survival mechanics
-Gripping environmental storytelling and sci-fi mystery
-A genuinely emotional solo experience

Cons:
-Early-game pacing may feel slow to some
-No multiplayer (intentional, but occasionally requested)
-Navigation can be disorienting without a custom beacon system

Subnautica is not just one of the best survival games—it''s one of the most memorable single-player adventures of the decade. Dive in. Just… don’t look down.

Theres so few games that take place under the sea and fully explores this concept, you could probably count all of them on one hand. Subnautica offers varying levels of depths (hehe) and a plethora of distinctive biomes to explore, each being breathtaking in their own right.  
Its hard to discern whether you’re truly immersed yourself in the game or you’ve wet your pants. The creature and environmental designs do a great job at giving you a sense of dread and invoke feelings of thalassophobia. 
 Theres no rigid linear story, the game will heavily encourage you to visit certain points via pings. But,  you can play it at your own pace. Any story and worldbuilding that takes place needs you to read/listen to transcripts. I believe the story  is simple enough that you wont be lost unless you’re an airhead, which should help out underwater if you need extra buoyancy.
The survival aspect can be quite annoying at times but thats just me being nitpicky.  The music is okay and the ending is immensely satisfying if you stick to it.

Now, the main reason I am writing this. No, the game is not spyware. It’s a misunderstanding based on a recent update to the terms of service. What happened was the games publisher, Take Two Interactive, updated the terms of their end user license recently. Several actors in the Borderlands community misread these changes as them turning the currently released games in the franchise into literal spyware. This is not true. The games are perfectly safe to run and your data will not be stolen. The codebase for the games is unchanged, all the update did is add an advertisement for the upcoming fourth game and you have to agree to the new EUL before you can play online. That said if you feel uncomfortable playing due to this controversy or Take Two changing the EUL without your consent, I understand. I post this only to clarify the situation and will update it as needed. 

If you want more on the situation, this Reddit post does a good job explaining it:
https:// old.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1kusnqa/new_eula_question_if_anyone_knows/mu4esbx/?context=3

QnA:
Will the game spy on me?
–	NO. The games code base is unchanged from before the update. The game itself will not collect any information.

Will I need a Kernel Level Anti-Cheat which will spy on me?
-	NO. You will not need to install any anti-cheat to play Borderlands 2. The update did not change this.

Why has the EUL been changed?
-	Take Two recently bought Gearbox and thus the rights Borderlands franchise. As part of their acquisition of Gearbox, Take Two is updating all online games Gearbox to use their EUL since they host the servers now. 

Can I play without agreeing to the new EUL?
-	Yes. You will have to play the game in offline mode and cannot access multiplayer features, but you can still play without agreeing to the EUL.

Will I be banned from multiplayer or sued by Take Two for using mods?
-	NO. The game is a 10+ year old co-op shooter. Take Two does not care if you mod it. This part of the EUL is relevant for modern releases and in active development projects such as Grand Theft Auto Online where cheating and piracy via mods is a very real problem. 
  
Will I be banned from multiplayer for using foul language?
-	NO. Again, this is a 10+ year old game. Take Two does not care if you trash talk your teammates. Again, this part of the EUL is relevant to more modern projects. Still, please respect your teammates.

 What data does the new EUL cover?
-	Emails, phone numbers, username, name, IP address, and passwords if relevant. If this sounds concerning, know that this is standard for many EULs where you need to create an account. You provided all this information except the latter to Steam when you created your account, Take Two just asks Steam to look at this information. The password clause is only for your Gearbox Shift account, it will not steal banking passwords or your Steam password.

Lets just change the rules for no reason at all.
EULA states in point 2.3 that you cannot modify the game (aka create mods).

[EDIT] Here is the passage, I removed some stuff not related to modding, you can compare to the EULA if you want: "... The limited license granted in this Agreement does not give you any right to, and you may not, ...,modify, create derivative works, ...,or otherwise exploit the Services (including the Content), ... unless subject to separate, express written terms provided by Take-Two permitting such conduct"

EULA states at section 17 that the US is a corporate dystopia (forced arbitration)
[EDIT] Yes I say forced, because nobody will do the opt-out, from the EULA: ".. If you wish to opt-out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept this Agreement (“Opt-Out Notice”) unless a longer period is required by applicable law"

EULA sates at multiple points it can collect your data, as legalese is made to scam normal people, I cannot tell with certitude if it lets them just get the data form your computer or if its not just the data needed to create an account.

Some people say it''s not a big deal, that the game itself actually doesn''t enforce it or ever will, so its perfectly ok. I disagree, If it lets them, but they will never do it, Why change the EULA in the first place?
Some people will say that reacting now while the EULA has been changed in February is dumb, and not valid. You can look around, it''s an argument that is being made. Obviously you can react whenever, there is not a rules that says you have to be aware of everything at the second it happens.
[EDIT] The EULA was last updated February 28, 2025, as stated in the EULA: "Last Updated: February 28, 2025" 

If the game didn''t have this EULA 13 years ago, it doesn''t need it now.

Obviously like all the EULA stuff, it is rarely enforced, and is just a sad reality of modern gaming. It doesn''t change anything about the game, which is still good.
[EDIT] Yes my review is positive, because the game is good, and it didn''t change. I don''t see why I should have a negative review just because the EULA is the same as all other modern games. Yes it sucks they changed it, but it''s not a dealbreaker to me.', '2025-06-06 10:21:15');
INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (205, 189, 391540, 4, N'It is fairly impossible to discuss Undertale and what it is, without discussing what it isn''t. It truly isn''t the most revolutionary game on its engine, but it did prove to be innovative. Toby Fox, a veteraned modder of Earthbound/Mother 3, who had cut his teeth with making ROM hacks, went on to make something truly interesting with Undertale.

Undertale is not so much a game, it is more a vehicle for a much larger fandom. And a fandom that has proven to be so significantly diverse, talented and at times, outright insane and intolerable, that it ironically had become the anti-thesis to the thesis of the game. But Undertale, itself, a game the embraces minimalism and yet, has ambitious, big ideas and remarkable presentation at the cost of anything being fairly high-brow, truly does something that few media forms can do. 

And that is give an entire generation of internet denizens schizophrenia. There was a time where you could not escape the Undertale memes. Even if you have never played Undertale, you sort of ''have'' through symbiosis. Like background radiation, you have absorbed so much of this game without realizing it by simply being on the internet during a certain time. But to actually play and experience it for yourself is oddly intimate, despite it arguably being more enjoyable via vicariousness. 

When I lived in Denmark, ever briefly for three years, I more or less was attending the Viborg Animation Workshop, Graphic Storytelling course for free. I simply would just show up to classes, simply because I knew people there, as a perpetual ''guest'' and while I would gain no credential, I would be surrounded by peers of the creative pursuits and arts. Not only that, but I got to meet many guest teachers from around the world, who made some significant IPs. Be they cartoons, be they comics... I also knew people who were studying 3D animation and modeling for video games and CGI special effects. 

But one person, I remembered very significantly was an Israeli man, who had boldly given up his Israeli citizenship for a Romanian one, just to get away from his country. His name was Tomer and he was gay. And he had a wicked sense of humour and some strong artistic direction with his own works. The man had also formerly been an Israeli commando and had grown to greatly resent this time in his life. Regardless of the details, he was an individual who was the embodiment of an art student. An open Marxist-Leninist. A conscious objector to the nation he was once born in and once served. And above all, a fan of Undertale.

A game he only played once.

I had played Undertale years prior around its release, inspired by videogamedunkey''s video, which admittingly, spoiled a lot of the game. But I still enjoyed the humour and while it is far from my favourite game of this sort (Note, I am a huge fan of Fear and Hunger 1 and 2, which I''ve jokingly called "Undertale but good and edgy"), but what got me to REALLY play it again on this very steam account, having had to make a new one upon migrating to Denmark, was Tomer''s unquestionable appreciation for his first playthrough.

A playthrough so absolute and impactful, blind and entirely driven by his own motivations to see it through for himself, that he wished to never play it again to preserve it a perfect memory. 

I had already forgotten some of the finer details in Undertale at this time and when I did go through it again, it clicked. And I ''got it''. My second playthrough of Undertale was ''that'' play through, an experience of my own and one... I don''t want to sully by playing again anytime soon.

Undertale is a psy op, a cult. A fandom that was vile, but also immensely impressive. Undertale has some immense flaws and some drawbacks, but it was made with passion. And frankly, love it, hate it. I recommend letting go of your vicarious enjoyment from memes and other people''s opinions, do your best to just erase any memory of it and then play it blind without any worry of getting the best or worst ending. 

It is definitely one of the most games of all time. Toby Fox has dedicated himself to become a Yoko Taro-esque figure in recent years as he developed Deltarune, but it is cannot be understated how much he earned himself a spot in the unique zeitgeist of this era of the internet. 

Decades from now, this game will be remembered. And you will remember the people who remembered it before you played it even. A friend, now long gone and lost from this physical existence on Earth, once had her icon as Napstablook on skype. And I remember, with one of her quotes in her status, everyone was suddenly concerned for this person''s mental health. Years later, we were certainly reminded that this was a healthy concern we should have kept up. 

Still, I will remember Undertale as a very strange experience that prominently will be bathed in nostalgia for a world that does not exist anymore. And memes left still quoted, but otherwise unspoken.

It was bigger than it deserved, but as satisfying than it needed to be. Just like your mum. Am I right lad, or am I right lads? (You are right lad)', '2025-06-12 18:32:00');

The game does that for you. Because apparently the developers saw how little effort gamers were putting into life and said, “Let’s meet them halfway.” It''s like a bullet hell shooter got drunk and passed out on a CRT monitor from 1993, and somehow, it’s art.

And oh, the dopamine. Every pixel explosion, every shiny gem, every upgrade — it’s like your brain is getting suckled by an arcade machine from a timeline where Castlevania went completely feral. Level up every 7 seconds.

The soundtrack? Banger. Absolute banger. I’ve started hearing “Revenant” in the background while doing dishes. My dishwasher has a kill combo. I don’t even have a dishwasher.

The characters? Oh, the deep, rich, emotionally resonant lore of “Guy With Axe” and “Skeleton With Gun.” There are approximately 947 playable characters and they all boil down to: “Hits stuff good.” Thank God. If I wanted emotional arcs, I’d rewatch Breaking Bad. I’m here to walk in a circle while deleting legions of undead like a Roomba with war crimes.

And don’t get me started on the items. Laurel? Yes, please, give me a shield so I can feel something. Clock Lancet? The game equivalent of putting the entire universe on hold while you decide whether to eat string cheese. The real star though? Garlic. You get Garlic, and you become a stinky god of rot and glory. You ever walked into a room so pungent you kill Death itself? You will.

Eventually, the game rewards you with a mode called Endless. Bold of them to assume I haven’t already been living in that mode since the day I installed it.

And yet. And yet. I cannot stop. I am freebasing pixels. I am optimizing builds in my sleep. I see red XP gems in my dreams. My mouse hand has calcified into a permanent WASD claw, but my soul? My soul is radiant. Bathed in golden chests and the unholy light of duplicator rings.

Obviously, that’s because this is the best game I have ever played.

Where do I even start?

I originally built my gaming PC with flight sims in mind, stuff like MSFS, DCS, and similar. I figured those were the only kinds of games I’d ever touch. Honestly, I don’t even really consider myself a “gamer.”

That said, I’ve always been in awe of huge cities. I live in a medium-to-small city myself, but I’ve been lucky enough to travel to some major ones, and from the very beginning, I’ve loved everything about them. The hustle and bustle, the giant highways, it all fascinates me.

I’d heard of Cities: Skylines a while back but never paid it much attention. I didn’t realize a game could actually simulate that specific love I have for cities. Then one day I saw it on sale on Steam, read some reviews, and thought, “Why not? I’ll give it a shot.”

And for the first time since childhood, I was glued to a game.
Time flew. I played for six hours straight after installing it, but it felt like half an hour. It was like discovering my first Minecraft cave when I was 12, all over again. I had never gotten addicted to a game so quickly. It was wonderful.

This game makes you feel smart. Proud. Like a problem-solver, a designer. A city builder.

It’s not for everyone. Not everyone’s going to enjoy spending hours figuring out how to optimize traffic flow from the industrial zone to the commercial zone, all while managing raw materials, worker supply, and outside connections.
But the crazy part? I didn’t think I would, either.
News flash: I do. And it feels great. Seriously, solving those little logistical puzzles makes you feel amazing.

Sure, the game has its quirks, some small bugs here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary for a game of this size and complexity. The only one you’ll probably notice early on is how vehicles change lanes, which can cause some traffic issues. But honestly, I wouldn’t even call that a bug. It’s just the game mechanics.

So yes. I highly recommend this game. To everyone.

If you’re reading this and even slightly think you might enjoy it, buy it. Sale or not, this thing is worth a million bucks. Even now, with Cities: Skylines II out for over a year, I can only hope that, with time and updates, it’ll capture the same magic this first one did.

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (218, 116, 976730, 4, N'Halo may just be the peak of the FPS genre. It stands tall and uncontested. It manages to stay relevant after more than 2 decades (and counting) due to its excellent timeless qualities:

+ an epic story that talks about intergalactic war and ancient lifeforms. This must be where Mass Effect took its inspiration from.
+ an epic soundtrack that impeccably puts you in the right mood, whether you''re absorbing the atmosphere with "walk in the woods", or driving through explosions left and right with Halo''s iconic main theme. Halo uses its soundtrack sparingly, which increases its impact and creates memorable moments. The pure absence of any music also works very well in certain missions.
+ epic combat with the covenant. The enemy AI was revolutionary for its day and remains so to this day. Enemies will go in and out of cover to regenerate their shield and outflank you. Every encounter is a game of cat and mouse, where you have to think about strategy in all aspect: Where will you attack? What weapons are available, how much ammo is there? Which enemies do you take out first? Are there objects that you can move? etc.
+ physics. precise grenade/rocket jumps allow you to reach places you didn''t think were possible. Learning glitches provide you with a whole new way of playing Halo. more on that later. The popularity of Halo means that there''s huge amounts of resources that teach you such tricks.

+ two amazing game modes that almost change the whole genre of the game:
1. LASO, Legendary All Skulls On, is a difficulty that''s so high, that you''re not really engaging the enemy head-on anymore. Rather it becomes almost a stealth game, where you go from cover to cover and backstabbing enemies as needed, praying that you don''t get discovered, because the little shield that you have don''t even regenerate on LASO. Where you do need to engage, it becomes a war of attrition, as there is 4x less ammo than normal, while the enemies have something like 4x more shields. So you will learn to conserve ammo and use every bullet as efficiently as possible.
2. Legendary 3h Speedrun. Technically not a game mode, but an achievement for completing a whole Halo game in under 3 hours on Legendary. When going for this, the game again changes completely, and now becomes some kind of precision platformer, where you learn to do precise grenade jumps, and move in precise locations to despawn enemies. I mean, practising and executing some of these tricks really made me feel like Master Chief. Possibly the most iconic one is in Halo 4 where you jetpack onto the ship, infiltrate, blow up the engine, then jetpack back to your vehicle, and you do all that before the ship has even finished its scripted animation sequence, where it''s supposed to park on a hill and let you transport upwards. Another is in Halo 2 where you throw 3 grenades in a precise way, then jump on the gondola. This spawns in the enemies, who immediately get blown up, as you watch and sail away to the next section.

And Halo has coop, so you can experience all of the above with a friend, though I need to say, if you play LASO or Legendary with 2 or more players, it becomes significantly easier, and the above doesn''t really apply anymore. Note also Halo 1 and 2 only support 2 player coop.

I only have 2 criticisms:
- some of my achievements got bugged and I can''t unlock them, possibly because the anti-cheat software wasn''t operational on my Steam Deck.
- changing your Xbox username costs €10 after the first time. absolutely ridiculous pricing. should be free.

But that doesn''t detract from the fact that Halo is a true behemoth in the FPS genre. And it''s also very cheap. One of the few games that''s worth it even at full price. Let alone on sale. You can easily get hundreds of hours of playtime from it.', '2025-06-11 05:00:01');

co-op campaign in mcc can be pretty rough when it comes to network stability. the way it''s set up, everyone has to stay in sync constantly, and if one person’s connection dips, the game will pause to let them catch up. sometimes it''s barely noticeable, but other times it turns into a lot of freezing and stuttering.

non-host players get the worst of it, with input lag that ranges from mild to really frustrating depending on the connection. if the network''s bad enough, expect frequent pauses that can last several seconds or more.

Probably the best real world medieval war simulator there is right now. I''m talking conquering kingdoms, executing kings, real time battles like lord of the rings.

[h3] Pros: [/h3]

The foundation for this game is ten out of ten, its pretty unbelievable. They have systems setup that are extremely complex, like relations with nobles, factions, trading, policies for your kingdom. And they''re done very well. It really does feel like i''m in a real time medieval war.

Everything already really good about this game is topped off with very well executed combat and ability to command armies. There''s a pretty big skill curve with the combat. You can get really good at playing the game, but you can''t become a one man army, its balanced very well. Commanding armies is really good, i really couldn''t imagine it being better. its pretty cool to be able to command a thousand guys.

[h3] Cons: [/h3]

A terrible thing but this game really just needs more content. They might add a lot more over the coming years but till then. I think they should add stuff for more of a reason to interact real time. Like there just isn''t a real reason ever to walk through towns or cities. You can interact with them on the map, but i think it would be a lot more immersive if there was a reason to walk through them. Also i shouldn''t have to manage my cities, the person governing the city should manage it for me.

And the bugs... There aren''t to many, but they are there. I have a graphical bug right now, where if i have my graphics turned up my game crashes. Says its a texture problem, could be my AMD graphics card though, really not sure. Also there was this really crazy one, where a bunch of parties were stuck fighting these bandits forever.

Most can enjoy the game for tens to hundreds of hours. Some could spend thousands of hours enjoying it. There is just that many ways to play it.



The game tends to focus on building and automation. Combat exists, but it is obviously not the focus and tends to fall more on automated defense as your progress. There are a lot of combat and enemy mods though so you can play as you like. 



I wouldn''t play multiplayer until you at least play through most of the game solo once. Part of the fun of the game is solving things your own way. A lot of the problems you run into have common solutions in multiplayer. So if you join multiplayer right away you''ll miss out on that phase of solving them in your own original way.



I''d recommend buying with Space Age expansion if you like the base game. There is enough added to be worth it. It also allows you to join all the multiplayer servers and not have to worry about which ones you can join.



After your first time you play the game I recommend you read through all the settings in the game settings menu. Some might be easier to understand what they are for after you play the game. And the default settings aren''t perfect for everyone. There are settings that make the good UI even easier to work with.

The story’s there if you want it, but let’s be honest: you’re here to smash demons, not read a novel. And the game respects that; You don’t play DOOM for deep thoughts. You play it to turn demons into red mist.

Now the maps? Huge, layered, and loaded with secrets. You’re not just running hallways — you’re leaping across platforms, unlocking hidden rooms, and hunting collectibles. Every level is like a violent puzzle box with blood and metal. There’s even fast travel at the end of every level so you can go back and grab what you missed.

I ripped and tore until it was done and it took me about 12 hours.  I did not check out the multiplayer but I did play arcade mode some.  TLDR, this is a return to DOOM''s roots and its a blast to play!



But that may not be what you are wondering about.  Dark Age just came out (I am in 2025) and you may be trying to figure out if you should get this one or Eternal or Dark Ages.  I can''t speak for Dark Ages, but I am playing Eternal now.  And they are just different games.  Eternal is like this game but with a lot of things turned up to 11, but that is not always a good thing.  I think that Eternal is a bit more silly; there are more movement abilities, neon ammo exploding out of enemies, and a less grounded story.  To put it in terms of 80''s action movies, this DOOM is like Aliens and DOOM Eternal is like Commando.  Eternal is more multiplayer focused if you are into that.  If you play one of these games you will likely want to play the other one.



So about me, DOOM 2 was the first actual computer game that I bought with my own hard earned cash from my swanky job as a subway sandwich artist in the 90''s.  I had played Wolf3D and the original DOOM a bit so yeah, I was totally radical.  DOOM 2 was a great kick in the teeth.  It was fast, brutal, and a lot of fun.  



Since then FPS'' have evolved though Unreal, Quake, Halo, COD, Destiny, and everything else so that things slowed down a bit.  Now it is a lot of peeking from behind cover and hiding until your health comes back.  It is refreshing to play a game again where that doesn''t happen.  You don''t take cover, the demons take cover from you.  You are bouncing off the walls, flicking rocket launchers and shotguns at them so fast that they can''t keep up.  This game is a survival horror from the demon''s perspective, with you hunting them down and them telling their little demon babies horror stories about you.  It is awesome, and I think that this game is a big part of why the boomer shooter genre exists now.



All of that comes out well in the Arcade mode, which is just self contained levels with a score total.  You go in and ruin a small city of demon''s day as fast as possible.  For me if this game has legs it will be that.  



The campaign is pretty good too.  Story wise I felt like it took a bunch from Dead Space 2.  But then I realized that''s backwards.  This game is the basic plot of DOOM and Dead Space took inspiration from that.  My main gripe with the campaign is that they gate some of the things that make this game fast and fun behind armor and weapon upgrades.  At the start it feels a little slow and clunky in the campaign because of that decision.  



So in conclusion, yeah this game is great.  The campaign is about 12ish hours long.  There are huge windy campaign maps with a ton of secrets and collectibles hidden in them.  It also has multiplayer which I did not check out.  And the arcade mode is a ton of fun.  And if you are reading this it is probably on sale.', '2025-06-26 13:02:37');

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (256, 151, 782330, 4, N'Characteristically, I''m late to the party and went in blind. Doom Eternal had sat in my library untouched for about 3 years before this for no particular reason, maybe because I thought Doom 2016 was alright but a little overhyped. I hardly remember that game at all now.

I played on Nightmare difficulty, which took me 30 hours for the base game and DLC, which I will refer to as the "game" as a whole from here on out because you''d do yourself a disservice not to play all of it.

First off, I want to say that the difficulty curve is incredible. Going back and watching someone play the first levels is almost comedic now, but I can also remember when they were genuinely challenging for me at the time as well. Aside from one instance, the difficulty ramp in the game never felt jarring and was always within my means to handle, which given the dramatic difference between the beginning and end is an achievement indeed.

The exception I refer to is the introduction of the Marauder; an inflection point in the game. This is the first time the game expects you to employ rapid weapon swapping to progress, technically you don''t [i]have to[/i] but it''s the intention.

I had not used this mechanic up until this point as the game had only brought it up once and I wasn''t yet onboard. I think encouraging the player to try it out a few times prior to the Marauder would have been better as having to both learn the mechanic and fight this new, difficult, enemy was a stretch both on my ability and my enjoyment of the game.

For a while I considered there to be two Doom Eternals, the one before the Marauder and the one after. I was digging the arena based combat and having a lot of fun, then this wall appeared which, when it cropped up, made me instantly dislike a section. Of course eventually I got good and started to enjoy fighting Marauders once I had a greater mastery of the combat loop, but I think separating the two lessons of weapon switching and the Marauder introduction more distinctly would have been an ambrosia to my bitterness. Also, the crucible should probably kill Marauders.

Somewhat related, I was a little resistant to the weapon swapping at first. It almost seemed cheesy. This quickly stopped being the case when I realised how satisfying and, later, essential it was. The immense power granted to you by this mechanic, when properly used, truly made me feel like the Slayer for the first time.

There''s something inherently rewarding about feeling like you''re breaking a game because you have knowledge of its systems, and that''s kind of what the weapon swapping and combat loop feels like the whole time, even though it''s intended.

One aspect I deeply appreciated was how the player''s time is respected. Almost always when hunting for secrets or having opened a new path, shortcuts will be unlocked either as jump pads, some bars retracting or a door opening up. None of these had to be in the game but I was happy to see them on every occasion they appeared.

A game that respects your time like that is a very quick route to my approval, it signifies developers who really understand what playing the game will be like. The single exception to this is the inability to save and quit during a mastery level, which was disappointing.

The main criticism I have of the game is that Id cannot design boss fights. All of the bosses were low points in the game other than at the end of DLC 2, which was almost good. The first boss, [spoiler]The Gladiator[/spoiler] is probably the most mechanically interesting in the base game, but none of the bosses are fun to fight, and I think that''s in part because they have to compete with the core arena combat loop in this game which is... well I''ll put it this way: Id couldn''t improve on it in Dark Ages.

Buff totems are a bit annoying if you''re unable to find them, which isn''t usually a problem but occasionally can be frustrating. I think a delayed HUD element to show the direction of the totem if you''ve not found it for a while wouldn''t go amiss.

After completing the game, I became aware that the platforming sections are rather maligned by a portion of the playerbase. Though I didn''t find them inspired, I thought they fit well into the game for the most part and were both varied and sparse enough to remain interesting.

There are more bugs than I would have expected. You will often clip the camera into walls during a glory kill and falling through floors or into walls will probably happen a few times in a playthrough. The consequences for this are usually mild, but this shouldn''t happen, especially in a game with a permadeath mode.

I played on max settings, 1440p, full ray tracing on an RTX 5070 Ti and was usually over 200 FPS. The game looks stunning, even being 5 years old. RT does add a lot and is, amazingly, not hard to run relative to rasterised performance. The Maykr levels in particular are visual feasts, The Holt is my favourite and one of the best looking levels I''ve ever seen in a game. I didn''t stutter a single time. The only repeatable source of performance problems were the particle effects from shooting a large group of frozen enemies, which did noticeably drop the framerate albeit briefly.

While you do need [i]mad skillz[/i] to beat the game on Nightmare difficulty, it''s not all about actions per minute. You need to understand the rules, timing and overall flow of combat to make split second decisions in a way that makes Eternal surprisingly cognitive.

Doom Eternal is best played on the highest difficulty you can manage.

When you are in the thick of it, against overwhelming odds and under siege by hordes of the mortally challenged, Doom Eternal''s core combat is truly outstanding; Id have squeezed everything they could out of it. The tension in the latter stages of a big fight keeps your focus sharp and your heart beating; only this intensity of ripping and tearing could give you the feeling of being the Doom Slayer.

With over 100 hours of gameplay, I can say that Forza Horizon 5 is, without doubt, one of the most complete and fun racing games I''ve ever played. One of the aspects that pleases me most is the amount of available content: there''s always something to do — races, challenges, seasonal events, or even just going out driving around the map, relaxing and enjoying the scenery.

Speaking of which, the visuals are a show in themselves: the map, inspired by Mexico, is extremely rich in details and has an atmosphere that makes you want to explore. The graphics are gorgeous, with varied scenery and lighting that enhances each landscape.

The gameplay maintains that arcade feel that the series does so well — easy to pick up, but with enough depth for those who like to adjust every detail. The driving sensation is fluid and responsive, making the game accessible for beginners while still being rewarding for more experienced players.

But unfortunately, not everything is perfect. If you, like me, use an NVIDIA graphics card, it''s good to know that the game still suffers from random and unpredictable crashes. I''ve already lost several online races and even stopped playing for some days out of pure frustration, and even trying dozens of solutions found on the internet, nothing worked. It''s frustrating to see this type of problem persist in a title released in 2021.

In the end, I partially recommend Forza Horizon 5 — especially if it''s on sale. It''s a great game, with many qualities, but one that still suffers from technical problems that shouldn''t exist anymore.

There are so many challenges in this game which makes it great for completionists, but it''s also a perfect game for more chill play in multiplayer or zombies as well.

Now with "Judgement of the Fool" probably in the best state ever!

Hunt is intense and extremely rewarding.
YOU WILL remember your fights and places long after they have been fought.

I have played now more than 2k hours and think a have never spend more time in a game.
The core gameplay loop and dynamic world never gets boring. Graphics are nothing but amazing. Weapon design, handling und feedback is unique and rewarding.

The only warning: 
- Watch tutorials on how to play and about the core mechanics. Hunt is not known to take new players by the hand
- Get a decent headphone as sound is extremely important
- Be ready to spend some time in the beginning, if you only want to play 1h/week then extraction shooters are not for you

For everyone else: get the game NOW.
The money/time spend and enjoyed is unbeatable.

I will never understand people playing >1000hours and giving this game a bad review.
Maybe it''s this emotional attachment you get, once immersed.

There is no other shooter like Hunt!', '2025-06-22 22:26:18');

INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (271, 240, 268910, 3, N'Cuphead is a game about "Well, 40 more tries and I''ll win"

Cuphead is a game with a simple story, but incredible gameplay.

I''ve already played it, and bought it with the aim of running through the story, and watching the dlc, but once I started I couldn''t stop.

As I said, the gameplay in the game is incredible, a large number of different bosses, a large arsenal of weapons, 3 ultimates, and many charms to choose from, allow the player to make their own tactics.

Getting all the achievements in general was not very difficult, but "Cooked to Perfection" made me sweat, I spent 5 hours on it and about 140+ attempts, but I think for some people it may be easier than others.

Regarding charms, I wanted to say about divine relic and astral cookie, the first one gives you the opportunity to play completely for your own pleasure, and simplifies the game 10 times, changing weapons is quite rare, and there are too many positive effects to pay attention to it, and the second one completely changes the game, since it is a separate character, I think that playing the game as Chalice would be quite interesting, but I didn''t risk it :)

Also, of course, how can we not mention the graphics, and they are simply incredible here, the stylization of old cartoons, the smoothness of the animations, and the understanding that it was all done by human hands takes it to an incredible level.

So, Cuphead is a pretty difficult game, but every achievement I got in it brought me incredible joy, and overall it was fun to play, it''s 100% worth the money, and gets a 10/10 (and if you want to get all the achievements, don''t forget about the DLC).', '2025-06-03 10:22:06');
INSERT INTO Reviews (ReviewId, UserId, GameId, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate) VALUES (272, 192, 268910, 3, N'Cuphead isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. From the moment the hand-drawn animations flicker to life, you know you''re stepping into something special. Inspired by the rubber-hose cartoons of the 1930s and powered by brutally challenging run-and-gun gameplay, Cuphead is equal parts artistic masterpiece and test of patience.

The Good:

Stunning Visuals: Every frame is hand-drawn, inked, and painted in a style that feels like a lost Fleischer Brothers cartoon. The attention to detail is absurd—in the best way possible.

Incredible Soundtrack: The jazzy, big-band score is not just background noise—it’s integral to the game’s identity. It pumps you up and sets the tempo for every boss fight.

Boss Design: Each boss is wildly imaginative, with multiple stages that evolve in surprising, often hilarious ways. It’s a masterclass in creativity and game pacing.

Tight Controls: Despite its chaos, Cuphead always feels fair. Responsive controls ensure that when you die (and you will), it’s usually your fault.

The Not-So-Good:

Unforgiving Difficulty: This game is hard. Not unfair—but absolutely punishing. It’s not for casual players or those looking for a relaxing time.

Minimal Story: The charm is there, but the narrative is light. If you’re looking for deep lore or character arcs, you might be underwhelmed.

Repetitive for Some: The game is boss-centric, with a few platforming levels. If boss rushes aren’t your thing, it might wear thin over time.

Cuphead is a rare fusion of style and substance. It looks like a vintage cartoon, plays like a bullet-hell classic, and feels like a labor of love. It will test your reflexes, your patience, and maybe your controller durability—but the sense of accomplishment after beating each boss is second to none.

If you’re into tight gameplay, timeless art direction, and don’t mind dying a hundred times to learn a pattern, Cuphead is a must-play.
